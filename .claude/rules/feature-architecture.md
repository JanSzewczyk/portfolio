```

`utils/`, `context/`, and `hooks/` are only added when a feature actually needs client-side
state/logic beyond the server-driven zones above — add on demand, don't scaffold empty ones.

- `utils/` — pure, framework-free (no React imports), unit-tested.
- `context/` — files named `{name}.context.tsx`, each holding the code around **one**
  `React.createContext` call: the context object, its `Provider`, and the consumer hook that reads
  it (e.g. `useProjectFilters`), co-located in one file.
- `hooks/` — general-purpose React hooks that do **not** define their own Context: standalone
  client-side logic (state, effects, polling, subscriptions), or hooks that build extra
  functionality on top of a `context/` consumer hook. A hook whose job is to create/expose a
  Context belongs in `context/`, not here.

**No top-level `index.ts`** for the feature — import from sub-paths directly:
`import { ProjectCard } from "~/features/projects/components"` ✓, never `.../projects` ✗.

---

## Server / client boundary

The most important architectural rule. Code splits into three zones:

| Zone         | Directory                               | Notes                                              |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Server-only  | `server/`                                | May carry `import "server-only"`; never client-imported |
| Shared types | `types/`                                 | No dependency on `server/`; importable anywhere    |
| Universal    | `components/`, `schemas/`, `constants/`  | Used by both server and client code                |

**Client components (`"use client"`) must NEVER import from `server/`.** Server modules often
carry `import "server-only"` (services, permissions) — importing them client-side is a build
error; even without that guard, leaking ORM types or server logic into client code is wrong.
`schemas/` and `constants/` are not client-only: Zod schemas validate on both server actions and
client forms, and constants are consumed everywhere.

```ts
// ✓ client component — from types/ and components/
import { ProjectStatus, type ClientProjectListItem } from "~/features/projects/types/project";
import { ProjectStatusBadge } from "~/features/projects/components";

// ✓ server component/page — server/ is fine
import { getClientProjects } from "~/features/projects/server/services/projects.service";

// ✗ client component — never from server/
import { ProjectStatus } from "~/features/projects/server/db/schema";
```

---

## `types/` — shared types between server and client

The **only** path from which client components may import domain types. All code may import here.

| Type category               | Example                                        | Why here                                          |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Domain enum const + type    | `ProjectStatus`                                | Used in component props and server queries alike  |
| Service result / DTO types  | `ClientProjectListItem`, `ClientProjectDetail` | Returned by services, received as component props |
| Public view types           | `PublicProjectView`                            | Used in both server pages and client components   |
| Filter / option types       | `ProjectStatusFilter`, `MemberListOptions`     | Passed from server to components as query params  |
| Cross-domain list items     | `ClientMemberListItem`                         | Passed from server to client card/table components|

Types tightly coupled to the persistence layer (raw row types, relation-query result types,
ORM-specific enum definitions) stay in `server/db/schema.ts` — they're used only inside
`server/db/queries.ts` and `server/services/*.service.ts` and never appear in component props.

### Pattern for domain enum const + type

Define the enum as a `const` object in `types/`, derive the type from it — never annotate with
`Record<Enum, Enum>` (widens the union and breaks `Extract<>` narrowing):

```ts
// features/projects/types/project.ts
export const ProjectStatus = {
  DRAFT: "DRAFT",
  ACTIVE: "ACTIVE",
  COMPLETED: "COMPLETED",
} as const;
export type ProjectStatus = (typeof ProjectStatus)[keyof typeof ProjectStatus];
export const ProjectStatuses = Object.values(ProjectStatus) as Array<ProjectStatus>;
```

The equivalent enum in `server/db/schema.ts` uses string literals directly and does not import
from `types/` — it stays independent so `server/` never depends on a client-importable module.

### `types/index.ts` barrel

Every `types/` directory has an `index.ts` re-exporting all sub-files: `export * from "./project";`.

### Service re-exports (optional)

A service may re-export the types it uses so callers have one stable import point, e.g.
`export type { ClientProjectListItem } from "~/features/projects/types/project";` inside
`projects.service.ts`. The underlying types still live in `types/`.

---

## Layer dependency rules (one direction only)

```
Action → Service → Permission → DB / API
             ↓              ↓
           Schema (Zod)   Data model schema

types/ ← imported by all layers, no restriction
```

Each layer imports only downward, never from the layer above. `types/` is the exception — no
dependencies of its own, importable by any layer.

---

## Return types per layer

| Layer                  | Type                                                                     |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| DB queries / mutations | `SupabaseServiceResult<T>` → `[SupabaseServiceError, null] \| [null, T]` |
| Permissions            | `SupabaseServiceResult<void>`                                            |
| Service reads          | `SupabaseServiceResult<T>` — wrap with `React.cache()`                  |
| Service mutations      | `ServiceResult<BaseServiceError, T>`                                     |
| Actions                | `ActionResponse<T>` from `~/lib/action-types`                           |

Import sources: `~/lib/supabase/errors` (`SupabaseServiceResult`, `SupabaseServiceError`,
`categorizeSupabaseError`), `~/lib/services/errors` (`ServiceResult`, `BaseServiceError`),
`~/lib/action-types` (`ActionResponse`, `RedirectAction`, `isActionSuccess`, `isActionFailed`).

---

## Service mutation guard chain (always in this order)

```ts
const [roleErr] = await requireRole(userId, [Role.MEMBER]);
if (roleErr) return [roleErr, null];

const [profileErr, profile] = await getCachedMemberProfile(userId);
if (profileErr) return [profileErr, null];

const [permErr] = await canCreateProject(profile.id); // feature-specific guard from permissions.ts
if (permErr) return [permErr, null];

const [dbErr, result] = await ...; // DB mutation
if (dbErr) return [dbErr, null];

return [null, result];
```

---

## Action pattern

```ts
"use server";
export async function createProjectAction(data: ProjectFormData): ActionResponse<Project> {
  const { isAuthenticated, userId } = await auth();
  if (!isAuthenticated) return { success: false, error: "Not authenticated" }; // project's UI language

  const [error, project] = await createProject(userId, data);
  if (error) return mapProjectServiceError(error);

  revalidatePath("/app/projects");
  return { success: true, data: project, message: "Project created" }; // project's UI language
}
```

No business logic in actions — delegate entirely to the service. `revalidatePath` only on success.
`map-service-error.ts` translates `BaseServiceError.code` to user-facing strings in the project's
UI language; never expose internal codes.

---

## Components

`components/` holds **both server and client components** — no fixed rule about which, each file
is what it needs to be. Names are domain-driven, not pattern-constrained. Subdirectories (`forms/`,
`portal/`) are used when grouping helps.

Default to **Server Components** (no directive, can be `async`). Add `"use client"` only for React
hooks, browser APIs, or event handlers that can't be passed down as server-action props.

| Component type                    | Import from `server/`? | Import from `types/`? |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| Server component                  | ✓ Yes                   | ✓ Yes                   |
| Client component (`"use client"`) | ✗ Never                 | ✓ Yes                   |

Server actions are passed as props to client components from the page/layout — client components
never import actions directly:

```ts
// page (server) wires the action in
<ProjectSidebar onUpdateStatusAction={updateProjectStatusAction} />
// client component receives it typed via types/
type Props = { onUpdateStatusAction(id: string, status: ProjectStatus): ActionResponse<void> };
```

Other rules:
- Never `useMemo` / `useCallback` / `memo` — React Compiler handles memoization.
- Button icons via `startIcon` / `endIcon` props, not children.
- Forms: React Hook Form + Zod resolver for complex forms; `useActionState` for simple ones.
- Co-locate `{component}.stories.tsx` next to every component file.
- `components/index.tsx` barrel exports named components only — no types, no `server/` re-exports.

---

## `db/` — persistence layer

The only place a feature talks to its data store. **Technology-agnostic at the architecture
level** — the rules below describe each file's role, not any particular ORM/database/driver. This
project's concrete implementation (schema syntax, client imports, transaction helper, error
categorization) lives in `.claude/rules/db-patterns.md` — the canonical reference for the current
stack. This section is the structure/role definition that holds even if the database changed.

| File           | Role                                                                        |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `schema.ts`    | Data model definitions + row/entity types inferred from them                 |
| `queries.ts`   | Read operations, one per function                                            |
| `mutations.ts` | Write operations (create/update/delete), one per function                    |
| `index.ts`     | Re-exports `queries` + `mutations` only — **never** re-exports `schema.ts`   |

Anything needing a `schema.ts` type imports it directly from `./schema` (or from the feature's
`types/`, if it's a DTO meant for callers outside `server/`) — `db/index.ts` is the entry point
for operations, not for the data model itself.

### Flat vs. nested layout

- **One domain schema** → flat: `schema.ts` / `queries.ts` / `mutations.ts` / `index.ts` sit
  directly in `db/`.
- **Two or more domain schemas** → nested: each schema gets its own subfolder under `db/`, named
  after it, with its own full set of those four files — same rule applies at every level
  (`index.ts` re-exports `queries`/`mutations` only). Don't mix a flat top-level schema with
  subfolders — once a second schema appears, every schema moves into its own subfolder.

```
server/db/                          server/db/  (2+ schemas)
├── schema.ts                       ├── index.ts            # re-exports all subfolders
├── queries.ts                      ├── {schema-a}/{schema.ts,queries.ts,mutations.ts,index.ts}
├── mutations.ts                    └── {schema-b}/{schema.ts,queries.ts,mutations.ts,index.ts}
└── index.ts
```

Rules that apply regardless of the underlying persistence technology:

- **One operation per function, no orchestration.** DB functions never call other DB functions —
  atomic multi-step composition belongs in the service layer.
- **Single object argument**, including an optional client/connection param so the function can
  run standalone or inside a transaction.
- **Transactions belong to the service layer.** A DB function throws on failure when called inside
  a transaction; the service owns `try/catch` and rollback.
- **Never throw across the layer boundary otherwise** — every DB function returns the project's
  result-tuple type and categorizes errors where they originate.
- **DTO/view types** live in `types/`, not in `queries.ts` — query functions import them for their
  return-type annotations.
- **Cross-entity operations** (touching an entity owned by another feature) live in
  `features/shared/server/db/{entity}/mutations.ts`, never duplicated into the calling feature.
- Register new tables/collections in the project's central schema registry.
- Logger: `createLogger({ module: "domain-db" })`.

---

## `api/` — external API integrations (optional)

Added only when a feature calls a third-party API directly (auth provider, billing API, payment
gateway), as opposed to its own persistence layer. Not scaffolded by default.

```
server/api/
├── {verb}-{resource}.ts     # one external-API concern per file, e.g. detect-clerk-plan.ts
└── index.ts                 # optional barrel
```

Same shape as `db/`: one function per file, single object argument where useful, result-tuple
return type, errors categorized at origin, never thrown across the layer boundary. `api/`
functions never call each other — composition happens in `services/`. Wrap read-heavy calls with
`cache()` the same way `db/` queries are, when safe to dedupe within a request.

---

## Permissions file

```ts
import "server-only";

export async function canCreateProject(memberId: string): Promise<SupabaseServiceResult<void>> {
  if (overLimit) return [SupabaseServiceError.limitExceeded(max), null];
  return [null, undefined];
}
```

---

## Test builders

```ts
export const projectBuilder = build<Project>({
  fields: { id: () => faker.string.uuid(), name: () => faker.lorem.words(3) },
  traits: { noDescription: { overrides: { description: null } } }
});
```

One builder per entity, exported from `test/builders/index.ts`. Builders run in the test
environment, so the same import rule as client components applies: pull types from `types/`,
never from `server/db/schema`.

---

## Logging

`createLogger({ module: "{domain}-{layer}" })` per file (e.g. `domain-actions`, `domain-db`,
`templates-service`) — see CLAUDE.md's Logging section for the `userId`/`operation`/`errorCode`
field convention, which applies here unchanged.

---

## New feature checklist

- [ ] `types/{entity}.ts` — domain const+type enums, DTO types, filter types
- [ ] `types/index.ts` — barrel re-exporting all type files
- [ ] `schemas/{domain}-schema.ts` — Zod + `*FormData` types
- [ ] `server/db/schema.ts` — data model + inferred types, registered in the central schema registry
- [ ] `server/db/queries.ts` + `mutations.ts` + `index.ts`
- [ ] `server/api/` — only if the feature calls an external API directly (optional)
- [ ] `server/permissions.ts` — `canDoX` guards
- [ ] `server/services/{domain}.service.ts` — guard chain, `cache()` on reads, re-export shared types
- [ ] `server/actions/{verb}-{domain}.action.ts` — thin, auth check, revalidate
- [ ] `server/actions/map-service-error.ts` + `logger.ts`
- [ ] `components/` — co-located stories, no imports from `server/` in client components
- [ ] `test/builders/` — builders import from `types/`, not from `server/`
- [ ] Schema unit tests + action unit tests
